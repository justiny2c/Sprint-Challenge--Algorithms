#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(n) - running once, and producing a basic math output


b) 0(n) - one For loop that runs once n times.  
    <!-- Possibly 0(n * logn) -->


c) 0(n) - one loop running n times, with a conditional to add 2 until n gets to 0

## Exercise II

I would start at the midway point of floors (f // 2), drop an egg. If egg breaks before, take LHS. If egg doesn't break, take RHS. I would keep splitting until the egg does break anymore to determine the value you f. 

Kind of like the "merge_sort" from problem from the other day, except we are just return a single number.

0(log n)
